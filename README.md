# password-generator
Assignment week 3

## Project Description
The goal of this activity was to modify a javascript file code to create a password generator.

The User can input a length between 8 and 128 characters.
The User is then given the option to choose which characters they would like to include; lower case, upper case, numeral and/or special characters.
The password generator then returns a password within the parameters chosen by the user.

If the User does not choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters it returns the message: "Please try again and choose a number between 8 and 128." and returns "Undefined" in the textbox

If the User does not choose any of the character types it returns the message: ""Please try again with at least one type of character." and returns "Undefined" in the text box
